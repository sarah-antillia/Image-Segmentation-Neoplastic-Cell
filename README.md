<p>
This is an experimental project for Image-Segmentation of PanNuke Neoplastic-Cell-Nuclei by using
 <a href="https://github.com/atlan-antillia/Tensorflow-Slightly-Flexible-UNet">Tensorflow-Slightly-Flexible-UNet</a> Model,
which is a typical classic Tensorflow2 UNet implementation <a href="./TensorflowUNet.py">TensorflowUNet.py</a> 
<p>
The image dataset used here has been taken from the following kaggle web site.

About this Dataset
This dataset, also known as PanNuke, contains semi automatically generated nuclei instance segmentation and 
classification images with exhaustive nuclei labels across 19 different tissue types. The dataset consists 
of 481 visual fields, of which 312 are randomly sampled from more than 20K whole slide images at different 
magnifications, from multiple data sources.
In total the dataset contains 205,343 labeled nuclei, each with an instance segmentation mask. Models trained 
on PanNuke can aid in whole slide image tissue type segmentation, and generalize to new tissues.
